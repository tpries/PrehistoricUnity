### Introduction
Asteroids raining down on earth are threatening to wipe out the dinosaurs. A couragous, fireball shooting Pterodactyl, our main character, is trying to save the dinosaurs 
from going extinct. It does so by destroying the asteroids (either by shooting fireballs or by colliding with them). If too many asteroids hit the earth, the dinosaurs
will be no more. Try your best to save them!

### Game Control
The dinosaur is controlled as follows: It heads into the direction of the mouse on the screen, while it accelerates with pressing the "w" Key. Pressing "a" and "d"
will rotate it to the side. "s" will slow the dinosaur down. By pressing the spacebar, fireballs are shot.

### Level System
The asteroids come in waves. The second waves starts after all asteroids of the previous wave are destroyed. With each wave the difficulty increases as more asteroids
are spawned and the distance between the spawned asteroids increases (which makes it harder to get them). 

### Final Notes
We made the dinosaurs (model, texture and animation) ourselves in blender. The other assets (terrain textures, trees, lava) are from the asset store. We got the sound 
effects from free online websites. For any further information on a specific sound effect please reach out to us. 

The sound and video of the video and actually also the game play quality is not the best in the video as our laptops could not really handle playing the game and recording it
at an acceptable frame rate and quality. Some sound effects may seem of which they are not in the actual game. If you want to play the game yourself please make sure the 
to play the game at 16:9.
